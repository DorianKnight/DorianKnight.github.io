                This project was an introductory investigation into how machine learning works, 
                what it’s good for and how to use it. Using TensorFlow, I was able to create a 
                feedforward artificial neural network model that classifies handwritten digits 
                from the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) database.

            <div class="page_header project_purpose">Purpose</div>
            <div class="descript_content purpose_desc">
                The project’s purpose was to start understanding how neural networks are made, 
                trained and evaluated. By experimenting with TensorFlow’s model libraries, 
                I was able to get a taste of what machine learning is capable of.

            <div class="page_header project_outcomes">Outcomes</div>
            <div class="descript_content outcomes_desc">
                By using TensorFlow’s libraries in Python, I was able to create an artificial 
                neural network that can classify handwritten digits from 0-9 with up to 95.84% accuracy.
                <br>
                I also experimented with varying the number of epochs used in model training and found 
                that more epochs aren’t always better. While an increase in training epochs resulted in 
                plateauing accuracy, loss continued to increase seemingly exponentially. This suggests 
                excessive epochs lead to model overfitting as the model learns the significant differences 
                but also learns the training dataset noise, which is undesirable for model generalizability.
