                The personal portfolio website is a bespoke collection of webpages coded using HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
                hosted using GitHub Pages. The website is a succinct distillation of my education, acquired skills and
                noteworthy projects.

            <div class="page_header project_purpose">Purpose</div>
            <div class="descript_content purpose_desc">
                The purpose of the personal portfolio website was to serve as a first step in building a personal brand. 
                When applying to jobs there is often a place to put a link either to GitHub, Linkedin or a personal website. 
                I've decided that I want to make a statement and showcase that I'm a hardworking talented individual with the tenacity 
                to have a vision and execute a project through to the finish.
                <br>
                This website serves the following goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>Start building a reputation even before I've said a word or sent an email.</li>
                    <li>Serve as a one stop shop for my personal links (GitHub, Linkedin, contact email, publications and resume).</li>
                    <li>To allow visitors to efficiently filter through my portfolio of work to find a project proving I have what it takes to join their team.</li>
                    <li>Show that I have initiative.
                        <ul><li>This is a hard skill to showcase on a resume but showcasing the results of my hard work will help to back up my resume and increase my credibility as a young engineer.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Make it easier to send cold emails to research teams/engineering firms.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Instead of spending extensive time guessing how to best impress a company, I could get my message across quickly 
                                by indicating interest and linking to a project that demonstrates excellence on my website. Furthermore, the project 
                                that I directly link to will already have adequate documentation assembled to accompany the project description.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Having all the information in one place will also allow me to skip the guessing game of figuring out "what I should 
                                show them" and instead provide them with a starting point for which a visitor can branch out and learn more about who I am.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                By encapsulating all of my work across various domains of engineering, I hope to better make the case why I'd be an excellent 
                hire and a great addition to any team I join.

            <div class="page_header project_outcomes">Outcomes</div>
            <div class="descript_content outcomes_desc">
                Using Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GitHub I have been able to design a functional website that allows visitors to learn the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Who I am (about me page)</li>
                    <li>My education (about me page)</li>
                    <li>My driving academic interests (about me page)</li>
                    <li>My skills (about me page)</li>
                    <li>My work (portfolio page)</li>
                </ul>
                The portfolio is filterable. By using the "type" and "skills" filters the visitor can quickly find projects that prove 
                that I have the skills they actively care about. While the website is always in flux, it will serve as a tool that can 
                grow as I progress throughout my career showcasing my accomplishments and skill growth.
